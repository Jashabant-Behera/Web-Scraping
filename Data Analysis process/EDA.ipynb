    "- `Normal Distribution`: Symmetrical bell-shaped curve where most data points cluster around the mean.\n",
    "- `Skewed Distribution`: Asymmetrical distribution where data points are concentrated on one side, resulting in a longer tail on the other side. It can be positively skewed (right-skewed) or negatively skewed (left-skewed).\n",
